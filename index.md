```
You are required to present a brief summary report on Istanbuls property market using official statistics. Your report should not be long but it should tell a good story. You are expected to use your dplyr & ggplot2 skills and present an HTML output generated by RMarkdown.

Please inspect the data set before you start coding. You will see some titles and explanations after the data.
Your report should include an introduction with max 2-3 bullet points about your findings (e.g. "Istanbuls property prices increased sharply during Summer 2020. I think that it is due to high demand because of cheap credit availability for that limited time."). Support your findings with one, or at most two visualizations. Have a brief conclusion part.
